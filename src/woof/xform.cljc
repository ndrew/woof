;; higher order funcs that generate the step handler functions


; woof workflow and transducers
;
; can transducers be used in the step handler function?

; is woof workflow a transducible process ?
;   â€” a process that is a succession of steps where each step ingests an input


; transducing fn

;; init []
;; step [a b]
;; completion [a]


; rules for applying transducers

; * If a step function returns a reduced value,
;;    the transducible process must not supply any more inputs to the step function.
;;  The reduced value must be unwrapped with deref before completion.
; * A completing process must call the completion operation on the final accumulated value exactly once.
; * A transducing process must encapsulate references to the function returned by invoking a transducer - these may be stateful and unsafe for use across threads.


;; so,

;; step handler function can be made from a transducer (xf or xform), where
;; reducing function
;;   * has signature (whatever, input -> whatever)
;;   * is a func that takes accumulated result and a new input and returns a new accumulated result
;;     or less formal
;;     reducible is a recipe for how to transform a given collection
;;


;; ?
;; reducing function transformers
;; algorithmic combinators
;; separate transformation composition from transformation application
