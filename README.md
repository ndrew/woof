## `WOOF`

Woof is a software experiment exploring different ideas about building software from re-usable blocks.

Woof tries to bring the application programming back and allow people to solve their specific problems by creating specialized applications for themselves powered by woof workflows.

### Rationale

**.. to be written later ..**

### Implementation

Woof consists of *[core library](woof-core/README.md)* for defining **flat workflows** and *prototype projects* that explore how workflows can be used 

Check the development progress in [woof-dev-log](dev-log.md)

#### Prototypes

##### [woof-playground](woof-playground/README.md)

Sandbox for running/defying woof workflows. 

Idea is to explore possibilities of using a generic UI for presenting workflow results/definining workflows/etc.

static site generator example


#### Examples of running woof workflows in different runtimes

* [woof-graal](woof-graal/README.md)
* [woof-lumo](woof-lumo/README.md)
* [woof-plank](woof-plank/README.md)
* [woof-shadow](woof-shadow/README.md)
