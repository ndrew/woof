# woof

reusable workflow implementation in clojure/clojurescript.

## Rationale

The idea is to use have a 'unit of work' implemented as a very specific, yet generalizable implementation of producer/consumer problem.

The goal of woof is to test the hypothesis that finite/infinite computations ('work', you know) can be organized via *flat workflows*.

Woof consists from two parts:

## [woof-core](woof-core/README.md)

core library for workflows 

## [woof-playground](woof-core/README.md)
playground for working running woof workflows
